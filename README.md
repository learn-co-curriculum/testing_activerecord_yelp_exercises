# Testing the ActiveRecord Yelp Exercises

## Learning Goals

- Write tests for model logic

## Instructions

- Go back to your solution to the [ActiveRecord Yelp Exercises](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/activerecord-yelp-exercises)
- Delete the body of all of the tests, but leave the names of the tests. Rewrite the test cases.
- Add tests for models that do not have tests (customer, order, review).
- Use https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov to check that all the methods are tested.
- Get your test code reviewed by a lead instructor, and revise based on the feedback
